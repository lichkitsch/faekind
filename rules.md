# How to Play _DNDuet_
_DNDuet_ is a system for creating and playing custom tabletop RPGs for two, one game master (GM) and one player.

<hr/>

## Character Creation
Roll `1d4-2` six times and put one score to each stat:

| Stats |
|:--- |
| _STR_ is for athletics, muscle, and melee attacks|
| _DEX_ is for acrobatics, stealth, and sneak attacks |
| _CON_ is for health, stamina, and endurance |
| _INT_ is for memory, logic, and reason |
| _WIS_ is for willpower, perception, and ranged attacks |
| _CHA_ is for personality, persuasion, and deception |

After you have your starting stat scores, come up with 1 flaw, 1 quirk, and 1 virtue to describe your character's personality. Come up with a background and a desire, then briefly describe your character's appearance.

## Action Rolls and Contests
When making an action with an uncertain outcome, make an **action roll** by rolling `1d20`, adding the relevant stat modifier, and checking the result against the _Air of Fate_. The _Air of Fate_ is a number that represents the level of difficulty the character is currently facing.

| Result | Outcome |
|:--- |:---:|
| &gt; AoF | Positive |
| = AoF | Mixed |
| &lt; AoF | Negative |

If the target can resist the action, they roll an opposing action (dodge, counter,  etc.) and you replace the _Air of Fate_ with the target's roll. This is called a **contest**.

## HP and Effect Rolls
Your character starts out with `10+CON` heart points (HP) at level 1. Creatures, objects, and tasks can all have HP, which represents the effort required to overcome them. On a successful action roll against a target with HP, roll your level-specific **effect dice** and reduce the target's HP but the result. Effect dice may also be used to replenish HP during a short rest or as the result of a move or item.

If the player's HP reaches zero, they suffer a major setback. This could mean imprisonment, dismemberment, or even death.

## Moves and Items
Creatures and characters can have up to 4 **moves**. Moves are special actions that your character can make thanks to their specific talents, abilities, or physical features. As you level up, you gain access to more moves and have the opportunity to swap out for different moves available to you. Moves typically reduce or replenish HP, but not always.

Items work in a similar fashion, but usually items are required to make certain moves or they only have a limited number of uses. Items might grant extra points to action rolls or offer the chance to reroll action or effect dice.

## Leveling Up
After reaching significant milestones, characters might gain a chance to level up and improve their character's effectiveness.

- Roll `1d10` _CON_ times and add the best result to your max HP
- Add 1 point to any stat that is less than 5
- Review your moves and swap one out if available
- Mark down your new effect dice

_DNDuet_ includes a level cap of 12, but with some modification using the "extended rules" your character can continue getting stronger well past this point.
