Edi wants $5000, not 12k rats.

Sorrel needs to get the salamander to the tower so that Alder can find out how it was captured. Alder reads the salamanders thoughts and recognizes Jasper as the child of the hunter he killed years ago, makes connection b/w Jasper and threat. "I know what I you are" refers to Alder as a dragon, not Alder as a fae.

Jasper gets a hold of Sorrel and holds her hostage to use as bait to draw out Alder. Alder and Fox save Sorrel, Alder cannot return to his dragon form as it was fatally injured in the fight. Fox focuses on saving Sorrel, becoming her shining knight.

Dahlia helps take out Jasper and by faerie law, Alder owes her one wish. She asks for custody of the Sprawl. While Alder cannot alone make the decision, the best he can do is give her the Seelie stake in the neutral zone and endorse her. Alder owns the land with Castor and with the collective residents living within the Sprawl. He complies, passing his shares to Dahlia.

Council of None
Council of Neither
Council of the Between
Twilight Council (caterpillars) can sense paths of the future and see Sorrel and Fox joining the courts.

Dahlia wants to drill and excavate the Sprawl to find her husband’s prison, deep underground.

Achillea wants to keep control of the Unseelie Court at all cost. 

The heirs to the thrones are enchanted to not touch to keep them from fraternizing. Maple ordered Basil to steal Achillea’s child and swap it for a changeling to retaliate for her mocking about their problems conceiving. Hemlock is a changeling and Fox (foxglove) is the true Unseelie prince. When Sorrel and Fox fall in love, the courts would merge and become a single neutralized faerie community, like the Sprawl but on a much bigger scale.

Fyr sided with humans in ancient times and was revered as a god, then was caged after humans started using fire to craft iron weapons which could hurt and kill faeries.

Light spirit gave up physical form to become the Twilight, a safe haven for faeries to live apart from humanity.

Fight/cage fire spirit w/ light and music?
