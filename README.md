Faekind uses the core _dnduet_ RPG system with modifications for magic spell-casting. The basic rules are listed below.

## dnduet Core System
dnduet is a system for building and playing custom tabletop RPGs. A game master (GM) controls the world in which the player character (PC) exists. The player makes decisions for their character and rolls dice to determine outcomes of uncertain actions, moving the narrative forward.

### Actions
Players roll `1d20+stat` to take actions with uncertain outcomes. If the action involves another creature, the result is checked against the other creature's own `1d20+stat` roll in a contest. If not, the result is checked against the _Air of Fate_, a target number representing the difficulty of the area or task at hand. Outcomes are as follows:

| Result | Outcome |
|:---:|:---:|
| > Target | Positive |
| = Target | Mixed |
| < Target | Negative |

### Stats
Sentient creatures in dnduet have six stats which are added to action rolls:

| Stat | Uses |
|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | Athletics, power, melee |
| Dexterity | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | Endurance, stamina, health |
| Intelligence | Memory, logic, strategy |
| Wisdom | Intuition, perception, ranged |
| Charisma | Personality, persuasion, deceit |

*When creating a character, roll 1d4-2 for each stat and set their level 1 starting HP to 10+CON.

### Heart Points
If the creature/object/task that the player is acting against has heart points (HP) and the result is positive, the player rolls effect dice and increases or decreases the HP of the target accordingly. Player characters have HP which can be increased or decreased by creatures/objects/tasks as well. If a character's HP reaches zero they suffer a major setback or, should the narrative demand it, death. HP is regained with items and spells, but can also be regained using effect dice after a short rest (4 hours) and back to full after a long rest (8 hours).

### Items and Inventory
Characters can carry up to 8 objects in their inventory. Items range from rank F to rank S and can have an effect on stats, action rolls, HP, and other areas of the game world. The ranks are explained below:

Rank
Type
Effect
S
Blessed
Advantage on some rolls
A
Legendary
+3 to certain action rolls
B
Very Rare
+2 to certain action rolls
C
Rare
+1 to certain action rolls
D
Mundane
No special effect
F
Cursed
Disadvantage on some rolls

### Leveling Up
When the PC has earned it and the GM approves, the character can move up a level:
