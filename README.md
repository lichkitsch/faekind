Documents repo for the first season of the _dnduet_ podcast, Faekind.

Faekind uses the core _dnduet_ RPG system with modifications for magic spell-casting. The basic rules are listed below.

## System
### Action Rolls
Players roll `1d20+stat` to take actions with uncertain outcomes. If the action involves another creature, the result is checked against the other creature's own `1d20+stat` roll in a contest. If not, the result is checked against the _Air of Fate_, a target number representing the difficulty of the area or task at hand. Outcomes are as follows:

1. If the result is higher than the target, the result is positive.
2. If the result is lower than the target, the result is negative.
3. If the result is equal to the target, the result is mixed.

### Heart Points
If the creature/object/task that the player is acting against has heart points (HP) and the result is positive, the player rolls effect dice and increases or decreases the HP of the target accordingly. Player characters have HP which can be increased or decreased by creatures/objects/tasks as well. If a character's HP reaches 0 they suffer a major setback or, should the narrative demand it, death. HP is regained with items and spells, but can also be regained using effect dice after a short rest (4 hours) and fully after a long rest (8 hours).

### Stats
Sentient creatures in _dnduet_ have 6 stats which are added to action rolls:

| Stat | Use | Abbr. |
|:---:|:--- |:---:|
| Strength | Athletics, power, melee attacks | STR |
| Dexterity | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse | DEX |
| Constitution | Endurance, stamina, health | CON |
| Intelligence | Memory, logic, strategy | INT |
| Wisdom | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks | WIS |
| Charisma | Personality, persuasion, and deceit | CHA |

* When creating a character, roll `1d4-2` for each stat and set their level 1 starting HP to `10+CON`.

## Items and Inventory
Up to 8 objects can be carried in a creature's inventory. Items range from rank F to rank S and can have an effect on stats, action rolls, HP, and other areas of the game world. The ranks are explained below:

| Rank | Type | Effect | Example |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |:--- |
| F | Cursed | Disadvantage for specific actions | Hexed bracelet: disadvantage when touching metal |
| D | Mundane | No special effect outside of purpose | Cell phone: contact allies and gather information |
| C | Rare | +1 to specific actions | Magic map: +1 when using map to find secrets |
| B | Very rare | +2 to specific actions |  |
| A | Legendary | +3 to specific actions |  |
| S | Blessed | Advantage for specific actions | Lips of Sacred Silver; kiss to heal one fatal wound, one use |
