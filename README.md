Documents repo for the first season of the _dnduet_ podcast, Faekind.

Faekind uses the core _dnduet_ RPG system with modifications for magic spell-casting. The basic rules are listed below.

## System
### Action Rolls
Players roll `1d20+stat` to take actions with uncertain outcomes. If the action involves another creature, the result is checked against the other creature's own `1d20+stat` roll in a contest. If not, the result is checked against the _Air of Fate_, a target number representing the difficulty of the area or task at hand. Outcomes are as follows:

1. If the result is higher than the target, the result is positive.
2. If the result is lower than the target, the result is negative.
3. If the result is equal to the target, the result is mixed.

### Heart Points
If the creature/object/task that the player is acting against has heart points (HP) and the result is positive, the player rolls effect dice and increases or decreases the HP of the target accordingly. Player characters have HP which can be increased or decreased by creatures/objects/tasks as well. If a character's HP reaches 0 they suffer a major setback or, should the narrative demand it, death. HP is regained with items and spells, but can also be regained using effect dice after a short rest (4 hours) and fully after a long rest (8 hours).

### Stats
Sentient creatures in _dnduet_ have 6 stats:

| Strength |  | STR |
