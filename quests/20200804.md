# Quest for Clove
Sorrel and Fox watch a few fights in the Sprawl before going "behind the scenes" where Sorrel shows him the training room and they share fighting techniques.

Afterwards, they meet up with Alder to talk about Jacob and Sorrel gets a message from Myrtle about helping Clove with an errand.

Clove needs some special ingredients from the Twilight for an important, secretive client, but its more dangerous to enter the Twilight now with Jasper Thornbeast running around. Myrtle wants Sorrel to help her retrieve the ingredients since they fought well together against Goatsbeard.

The two ingredients are Pandora Snail Shells from the cave beneath the moving mountain and Singing Aloe from the moving mountain's peak.

The secret client is working for Dahlia and is trying to create a magical lockpick for Fyr's cage in lieu of having Sorrel sing for her.
