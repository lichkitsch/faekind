# Quest for Clove
Sorrel and Fox watch a few fights in the Sprawl before going "behind the scenes" where Sorrel shows him the training room and they share fighting techniques.

Afterwards, they meet up with Alder to talk about Jacob and Sorrel gets a message from Myrtle about helping Clove with an errand.

Clove needs some special ingredients from the Twilight for an important, secretive client, but its more dangerous to enter the Twilight now with Jasper Thornbeast running around. Myrtle wants Sorrel to help her retrieve the ingredients since they fought well together against Goatsbeard.

The two ingredients are Pandora Snail Shells from the cave beneath the moving mountain and Singing Aloe from the moving mountain's peak.

The secret client is an agent working for Dahlia, who is trying to create a magical lockpick for Fyr's cage in lieu of having Sorrel sing for her.

## Threats
|:--- |
| Pandora Snails secrete a hallucinagenic substance that causes psychic damage (clones of intruders appear to defend snails) |
| Singing Aloe is protected by a field of shambling mounds (20HP/1d6DMG) |

## NPCs
|:--- |
| Fox wants to learn more about Sorrel's world and will stick close to her to experience it more while protecting her. |
| Clove wants to make money to keep her shop open and will insist on getting the ingredients even if she needs to get them herself. |
| Myrtle wants to help her aunt and will try her hardest to do so, since the shop means a lot to her too. |

Jacob works for Oberon but is bound to keep this fact secret. He was instructed to use Sorrel, that it would "do her good" to put her fighting to a real test and that it was her duty to serve her people.
