## Situation Review
Fox and Sorrel are visiting Dahlia so that Sorrel can investigate what happened last night when Fern and Ashe took Jacob to see her, since none of them can remember anything about the meeting. Fern also never got Sorrel's text messages while she was with Dahlia. The construction vans at Dahlia's business somewhat match the description of the van that was used to smuggle the Salamander.

| NPC Review |
|:--- |
| Dahlia Richards wants to free her husband from his prison beneath the Sprawl, so her plan is to purchase the land from both Fae courts via wishes granted for saving their lives from dangers she herself set in motion. Dahlia supplied Jasper Thornfrost with equipment and information to bait Alder into a fight and freed Astrid to use her against the Blackwoods. She plans to step in and save the day, then use the fae rule of sacrifice to demand both shares of the deed to the Sprawl and threaten to take it by political force otherwise. Once she has the deed she'll start drilling. |
| Jasper Thornfrost wants to kill the dragon that killed his grandfather, who he only recently identified as Alder Danann. Jasper is interested in keeping the Fae a secret as well, but for the sake of the human world not knowing about the horrors of dragonfire. |
| Astrid wants to take the Unseelie throne and use the power against the Dananns to enact her revenge, and will do so by going after Hemlock. Astrid will likely find out Hemlock's origin after invading his mind and putting the pieces together, spelling trouble for Sorrel and setting off the dominoes for Fox to find out his true nature. |

## Locations
### Dahlia Construction
Four-story red-brick building in Wolfs Head, large maintenance garage adjacent. Shiny new sign, old building. Belvedere has the inner building stuck on a time loop as a defense mechanism; subtle things repeat on a cycle if noticed and there are no visible clocks. Dahlia's office is on the third floor, of course. She has a modern style with lots of ironwood style furniture and sleek, dark building models. Lots of black metal, cherry-red wood, and glass.

| Talking with Dahlia |
|:--- |
| Dahlia will deny everything, say that they had a pleasant and wonderful time together after she found an acceptable cure for Jacob's affliction (a sort of fae headache, she claims) which was interfering with his magic. She won't elaborate and if pressed will simply say that if Jacob is still having issues it isn't something magical. |
| Dahlia will admit to being a witch easily, but will still deny using magic to erase their friend's memories, saying that she's hurt they would think so poorly of her. |
| Dahlia will not tell Sorrel why she wanted her voice, but will say that the recording wasn't quite what she was hoping for and ask if there's any chance she could have Sorrel perform live for her someday soon. |
| Dahlia will claim that one of her trucks was stolen and that she filed a report with the police but hadn't heard anything since, and that she'd turned over employee files and data to the police to help with the investigation. |
