# Faekind

## Last Actions
- Sorrel, Fox, and Alder headed for Arrowwood Isle after Basil's attack
- Maple was left with Dr. Lemna for treatment on her leg
- Sorrel and Fox found Oberon's secret study and lab under the iron hatch
- Sorrel uncovered Oberon's real body

## Threads
- With Basil on the loose and Oberon's spies all across the island, the Dananns need a safe house
- Fox offers up his apartment for the safe house, keep that content (but redo the danger of Oberon part)
- Connect blue magic with Thornfrosts and Dahlia?
- Shade has been acting weird; needs help finding Cy after he left Shade a cryptic message

## Loose Ends
- The Blackwoods don't know the truth about Hemlock or Fox
- Basil had access to a time machine, as did Astrid; connect Lavender to time machines
- Need reasons why Oberon is dangerous:
  - He and Titania led the conquest to bring all the fae kingdoms under one banner, always after more power
  - Unseelie rebellion was strong enough to warrant a truce, avoid too much bloodshed 
  - Cursed his own family to keep them away from Unseelie, punish those who refuse
  - Wants to keep controlling things from behind the scenes, only worried about Blackwoods and doesn't care about Dahlia or the spirits
- The Unveiling wanting to reveal fae to humans
