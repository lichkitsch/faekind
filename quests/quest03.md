| Notes |
|:--- |
| Driving, Fox asks how she ended up across town |
| Jacob sick on steps, needs book for spell |
| Missing powdered butterfly and purple pepper flakes |
| Buy from Clove's Cultivars, just outside Sprawl |
| Buckeye having issue with Clove being outside the Sprawl and selling to humans |
| Ingredients cost $200 (rare) |
| Clove will eventually agree to move on two conditions: Sorrel endorses her shop before her next fight and she gets to "read" both Sorrel and Fox |
| Convince Fox, she tells him that his oarents didn't give him up on their own, that he was taken from them |
| Clove tells Sorrel that her "heart" is in danger |
| Get ingredients to Jacob, get him healing |
| Fox quits his job to work for Alder full-time (intrested in Clove's reading and Sorrel's strange world) |
| Sorrel wants to see Beech again to get her number and ask again if she enjoyed the show |
| Beech a little mad that Fox locked her door; she left her keys thinking that Sorrel wouldn't worry about locking the door and ended up having to ask Hemlock to let her back in which was embarassing |
