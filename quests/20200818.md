Sorrel wants to help Fox find out what happened to Achillea's second baby, since there's a possibility that he's the long-lost Blackwood mentioned in Achillea's diary.

- Sorrel hasn't updated her parents on the Dahlia/Fyr situation yet
- Sorrel needs to ask her parents about the second son mentioned in the diary
- Parents claim to not know anything about the second son, want to know where the question is coming from

Go to past to find out what happened firsthand:

1. Need to know where to find Achillea
2. Need to be careful to not be seen

See Basil taking the eggs? Drops one in the swamp and takes off with the other one? Back to present, bring info to Alder?

Fox transform while in the past to protect himself/egg from being eaten? Fights off gators maybe

Use L machine to get back, Burdock to return, must talk to jacobi to get help getting back

**Erase joke abt showing shade tits/fox asking abt tits**
