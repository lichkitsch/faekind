fox: "I think... yeah I have something I want to do before we go see Beech."

(fox goes to put in like a month of vacation time that he's saved up) "There's some weird things happening around you and I want to know more. I have a feeling you can't or won't tell me what the hell is going on, but that's alright. I am a detective, after all."

beech "Nobody would bother to steal my shit. Everyone knows I work for the Blackwoods.

I had to break my fucking lock by the way, so thank you for that."

Fox and Sorrel wake up on a yacht in the middle of the bay, hands tied behind them and facing Achillea, some fae bodyguards, and Castor (who shows up after tossing someone overboard out of sight "don't look so grim, he had a vest on").

Fox still has a hood on his head and can't see the bodyguards, who aren't glamoured well.

Achillea reprimands Sorrel for stepping into their territory, takes the address from her and asks why shes been "snooping".

She gets pissed that Sorrel would let Jacob (a valuable asset to both kingdoms) wander into a stranger's hands.

Wants to know what the seelie know about the smugglers. She reveals that one of their agents was wounded recently (redd) but won't give details.

Wanting to keep the peace, Achillea hands then over to Basil, who shows up with Alder on the family boat to retrieve them. "You're slipping, Danann."

Hooks:  
- Jasper closing in on Alder, might use Sorrel for bait  
- Fox revealed to be fae (prince reveal later?)
