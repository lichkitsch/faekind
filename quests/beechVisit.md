# Name of Quest
## Review
Sorrel left Ash, Fern, and Jacob before they went to see Dahlia. Fox is driving Sorrel to Beech's apartment on the other side of the river. Several plotlines to follow:

1. Alder/Malva/salamander situation
2. Jasper hunting Alder
3. Astrid/Dahlia/Jacob situation
4. Maple/Fox/Hemlock situation
5. Beware text from unknown

## NPCs
- **Fox** wants to learn more about Sorrel's world, so he quit his job to pay closer attention.
- **Beech** wants to get away from Hemlock for a while, so she snuck away, back to her apartment.
- **Hemlock** wants to put an annoying curse on Sorrel as a prank, so he tried (unsuccessfully) to make a plan with Beech.
- **Alder** wants to keep the Fae safe and secret, so he'll send a team to get the salamander from beneath Malva's club.
- **Achillea** wants to know what the Seelie Princess is doing in her territory, so she'll have her brought to her.
- **Castor** wants to expand his reach, so he's negotiating with Jasper Thornfrost when Sorrel arrives at their home.

### Blackwood Palace
The Blackwood's "palace" is actually a moderately-sized yacht floating in Paragon Bay. They live in a penthouse overlooking the wharf, but conduct most of their business on the water. Castor is a Sea Troll, hairy on land but more like a barbed shark when in the water.
