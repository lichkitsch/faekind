## Scenario
Sorrel has a strange dream about the gems and Astrid, and when she wakes up she has a text from an unknown number that just says "She got out." The number turns out to be Jacob's new phone that Fern bought for him. There's also a voicemail from Sorrel's mom asking if she can speak with her (and to bring Fox along).

Fox went back to his apartment but is having breakfast with Basil in the kitchen, waiting for Sorrel when she comes out.

## Potential Paths
1. Check on Jacob and/or Dahlia and ask about Astrid.
2. Go see Maple, get a lecture about Blackwood territory and interrogated about the trip back.
3. Check in with Alder or Malva, ask about Salamander situation.
4. Check in with Beech, ask about Hemlock or address from map.
