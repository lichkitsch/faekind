Sorrel wants to ask Fox if the kiss was only bc he was drunk. "Didnt kiss me ffor laughs"

Sorrel rolls for tasks to see how well she can accomplish them?
- Learning Faespeak (INT)
- Translating the diary (INT)
- Practicing for BotB (CHA)

She practices for two weeks with nothing big getting in the way but we come back in with Jacob and a lead on Moonwort.

Moonwort the siren is very dangerous and looking for a good escape.

Jacob has a lead on Moonwort; she's gone into the Twilight to hide and there have been reports of her causing trouble there.

Fox follows Sorrel this time, entering the Twilight after her. He thinks they're just in the woods or having some kind of hallucination, but before Sorrel can do anything about Fox, Jasper appears. He attacks, forcing Sorrel into a fight. They end up stuck in the Twilight this time, as Sorrel's magic is on the fritz due to her dragon transformation.

Jasper is still blind but fights using his other senses. He has patches of moss growing on his clothes and skin, likely a reaction of being in the Twilight for so long and feeding on Faerie creatures. He has gone through some kind of change, growing fangs and claws.

After they fight Jasper, Jacob comes to retrieve Sorrel and takes her and Fox back to Oberon Tower. Fox is probably going to freak out a little bit and demand to know more, but can't take him to the Sprawl. Maybe to the Library? Fox likes to read...
