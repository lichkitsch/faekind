Since she really wants Sorrel to go interact with Beech, I need to set up new stuff.

- Sorrel has 3 enchanted gems: ruby makes huge stabbers, emerald gives burst of speed, sapphire frosts what it touches.
- Astrid pissed and trying to escape, deal with Dahlia to weaken Jacob.
- Jasper is a descendent of a knight of the secret order of the Watchers, dragon hunters.


Sorrel fought Thorn, met the caterpillar, fought Beech and Oyster, text saying beware from unknown number, picked up by Fox and Redd, made up an excuse about acting in Hamlet, helped fight gangster smugglers after crash, hid and saw Jasper's car, got home and slept for a few hours.

Sorrel goes through the Twilight to pick up coffee, meets the caterpillar and Benny, cursed by purple-spotted deer, gets coffee from Fern, heads back to meet Dahlia and Belvedere, plays music for them. Alder gets threatening text.

Something happens, lunch with Sorrel, Fox, and Fern, Fox interviews to become Sorrel's bodyguard.

Somthing twilight Sorrel finds map.

Sorrel goes with Fern to get her library card, meets Jacob, redirected by Astrid to boar pit with babydoll puzzle, fights boar, fights shadow beast, meets Astrid. Astrid talks to Sorrel, wrong time, talks to Thaddeus, even more wrong, threatens to ransom her back to Oberon. Fern and Jacob appear, save Sorrel.

Jacob drops Sorrel and Fern off at the Nogarap library to meet Whisper and get Sorrel's library card. Whisper has cool rainbow mice that fetch documents for her, gives them address from map, Sorrel gets her card and they leave.

Go through Twilight to get dressed and meet up with Fox (fern finds crash remnants), head to Sanguine. Run into Hemlock and Oyster, meet Malva, run into bands (Sandra the ogre, digital dancers, gnomes), play show, meet ash, get drunk, play drunk recording for Dahlia, see Malva's secret salamander.

Heading back, run into very sick Jacob. Goes through bubble to get blue book, ends up outside Beech's apartment. Up fire escape, run into Beech, call Fox, waving causes fall over edge, Beech saves by pulling into apt, Hemlock comes and gets Beech, Fox comes and gets Sorrel, locks door.

Heading back to library with book, give book to Jacob, needs ingredients from Clove. Clove is arguing with Buckeye. Clove gives ingredients and "readings", Jacob starts to fix spell but passes out. Call Fern, she shows up with Ash, fixes up spell, Jacob needs to see Dahlia, reveals she knows Fae stuff. Sorrel leaves Fern and Ash to escort him with a photo. Heads out with Fox to go see Beech again. Maple texts video of Sorrel hanging off roof. Fox quits his job.
