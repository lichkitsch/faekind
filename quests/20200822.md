# Episode 100

## Review
While Alder is putting together a team and planning an expedition to the Antipode, Sorrel and Fox take a break before going to ask Maple about Oberon. Sorrel also needs to check her phone for messages and check in with her friends.

## Important NPCs
|:--- |
| **Fox** wants to have sex with Sorrel but the danger posed to her by Oberon's curse is too much to ignore. |
| **Maple** wants to keep her past a secret so she'll only tell Sorrel things about her dad from when she was younger. |
| **Achillea** wants to speak with Sorrel about stealing the Blackwood Books so she'll send her men to collect Sorrel from the Tower when they try to leave. |
| **Dahlia** is still experimenting with mushroom magic on humans but it hasnt become obvious yet. |

## Goal
Gather more information on Oberon and calm your friends over your disappearance.

- Sorrel woke with blood on her hands and made her way to Beech's apartment (closest friend)
- Who's blood? How did it get there?
    - Blood from one of Dahlia's guards, Sorrel came to attack her but was transported away by Belvedere
- Dahlia obviously won't want to admit the attack shook her (it did)

---
