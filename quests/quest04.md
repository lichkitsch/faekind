| Get Jacob to Dahlia at her tower |
| Her place is under construction still, and guarded by gargoyles |
| Dahlia has been acting with Buckeye to improve the Sprawl and has intimate knowledge of the Fae |
| "Of course I know you're a faerie, darling. I could spot you a mile away." |
| She's pretending to have the Fae's best interest at heart, kicking up a stink about the royal families, but then really she wants to rule them with Fyr anyway |
| Dahlia offers to fix Jacob (she poisoned him in the first place) |
| She introduces Vera, a dryad healer |
| Vera is a very serious, quiet, and precise person |
| Vera heals Jacob, but not without pain |
| Before Sorrel leaves, Dahlia tells her that there is a lot about the city she doesn't know and she would be wise to "expand her horizons" |
| Fox has to make a quick stop on their way home |
| Stops at police station to quit his job as a cop, leaves an apologetic note for Redd and asks the secretary to send it along with some flowers |
| Fox wants to investigate Sorrel's situation and friends to find out what's really going on |
| Alder will be surprised by news of the salamander and want to address it right way |
| The salamander is gone when they get there |
