- Someone name Jasper is smuggling fae in the city, or at least the one Salamander

<hr/>

- Dahlia owns a construction company
- Dahlia enjoyed Sorrel's piano playing
- Dahlia showed up to see Sorrel's show, paid money for Sorrel to sing drunkenly, and kept the recording
- Dahlia knows about the fae and the movements in the city enough that Jacob trusted her enough to seek her help with his illness
- Dahlia fits the motif we've established for vampires

<hr/>

- Astrid is out of her time
- Knows she's messing with Jacob and has some influence on his bubbles already, but doesn't seen to realize she's imprisoned
